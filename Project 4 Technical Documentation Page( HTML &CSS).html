            <header >Algebraic Expressions Formula</header>
               <p>An algebraic expression is made up of constants, variables and arithmetic operators. For example, 3x – 2 is an algebraic expression. In algebra, we substitute numbers for letters. The algebraic formulas are used to make calculations easier. To find a solution to the algebraic equation, we follow a process of finding a number or a set of numbers where, if they are substituted for the variables in the equation, reduce it to identity. And the numbers are called as zeroes.</p>
               <p>  Algebraic expressions can be categorized into various types based on the number of terms and powers of variables. <br><code> Some of them are given below:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li><code> ax, ax2, x3,… </code></li>
                   <li><code>Trinomial: ax2 + bx + c, ax3 + bx2 + cx,….</code></li>

               <p>Physics makes noteworthy offerings in new technologies that arise from theoretical advances. For instance, advances in the comprehension of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the improvement of new products such as computers, television, home appliances, and nuclear weapons; developments in thermodynamics led to the advancement of industrialization, and the progress in mechanics inspired the development of calculus. Conceptual understanding is a basic block without which you are nowhere.</p>
               <p>Only when one understands the theories thoroughly, they can easily find the relation between the quantities by which they can construct the formulas, derive it and learning them will be simple. <br><code>Questions in physics are something which challenges your skills and physics knowledge which are grounded on three things:</p>

               <p>The mass concept measures the quantity of matter existing in an object. It is a quantitative property of an object against the acceleration. The mass and weight of an object are not the same. </p>
               <p>The molar mass (M) is a physical property and it is defined as the mass of one mole of the chemical substance or it is a ratio of the mass of a chemical compound to its amount of chemical substance. The unit of molar mass is kg/mol. <br><code>The mass formula is given as:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li><code> =  ρ × v</code></li>
                   <li> <code>m = w / g</code></li>
                   <li><code>m = F / a</code></li>
                   <li><code>M = F / g</code></li>
                   <li><code>m = (E / c2)</code></li>

               <p>Entrepreneurship is the ability and readiness to develop, organize and run a business enterprise, along with any of its uncertainties in order to make a profit. The most prominent example of entrepreneurship is the starting of new businesses.</p>
               <p>It can be classified into small or home business to multinational companies. In economics, the profits that an entrepreneur makes is with a combination of land, natural resources, labour and capital. <br>
